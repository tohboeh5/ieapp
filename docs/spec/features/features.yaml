# Features Registry (API-level)

# The registry is intentionally API-operation oriented (not file oriented).
# Each operation is described with the columns:
# - backend: includes path, file definition location, and function name
# - frontend: includes path, file definition location, and function name
# - ugoite_core: includes file and function name
# - ugoite_cli: includes command, file, and function name
