    title: Freedom Through Modern Abstraction Layers
    statement: |
      Ugoite maximizes user freedom by adopting modern abstraction layers that
      reduce lock-in and preserve optionality. Storage abstraction, a reusable
      Rust core, open table formats, and portable protocols are treated as
      first-class architectural assets.

    title: Serverless-Oriented Minimal Node Topology
    statement: |
      Ugoite minimizes persistent nodes and infrastructure coupling. The target
      operating model is a small number of composable runtime nodes where
      clients can directly integrate with storage and AI services when safe,
      while keeping transitional adapters only where they are currently needed.

    title: Build Rules, Not Disposable Artifacts
    statement: |
      Ugoite prioritizes durable rules over one-off artifacts. Specifications,
      code, and tests are coupled so behavior can be re-validated continuously,
      and user workflows are designed to encode reusable intent rather than
      repetitive manual steps.

    title: Give AI Freedom Inside Trusted Constraints
    statement: |
      Ugoite treats AI as a force multiplier that should move quickly inside
      explicit boundaries. Strict CI, typed interfaces, trusted tools, and
      policy-linked specifications allow high AI autonomy while keeping risk
      observable and governable.
