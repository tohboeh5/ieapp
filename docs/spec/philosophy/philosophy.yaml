    title: Freedom Through Modern Abstraction Layers
    statement: |
      Ugoite adopts modern abstraction layers to maximize user freedom over
      data, compute, and integration choices. OpenDAL-backed storage,
      a Rust-based core, and open analytical interfaces are preferred so users
      can avoid vendor lock-in and connect from CLI, API, agents, frontend,
      and future native clients.
    implications:
      - Prefer open protocols, open formats, and replaceable infrastructure.
      - Keep a stable core that can be embedded in multiple application layers.
      - Preserve interoperability for future query and analytics backends.

    title: Serverless-Oriented, Minimal-Node Architecture
    statement: |
      Ugoite minimizes always-on nodes and treats infrastructure as optional.
      The ideal topology is a small number of containers plus storage, with
      direct client-to-capability integration where security allows. Extra
      layers may exist, but only when responsibility boundaries require them.
    implications:
      - Design for least operational burden and minimal fixed infrastructure.
      - Keep responsibilities explicit when introducing API or worker layers.
      - Prefer direct access patterns over unnecessary service fan-out.

    title: Build Rules, Not Artifacts
    statement: |
      Ugoite prioritizes durable rules over fragile one-off artifacts.
      Implementation should encode repeatable safeguards (tests, contracts,
      automation), and product interactions should let users define reusable
      rules rather than repeatedly performing near-identical manual operations.
    implications:
      - Every meaningful fix should reduce recurrence through tests.
      - Documentation should be connected to executable checks where possible.
      - Product workflows should elevate reusable intent over repetitive actions.

    title: Let AI Move Freely Inside Trusted Guardrails
    statement: |
      Ugoite embraces AI leverage while containing risk through explicit,
      testable constraints. Humans define and audit the guardrails (CI,
      policy checks, trusted tool surfaces), while AI operates with broad
      autonomy inside those boundaries.
    implications:
      - Strengthen CI and policy checks as the primary trust mechanism.
      - Expose trusted tools for AI-assisted operations on private data.
      - Optimize for high AI throughput with strong traceability.
