    title: Editor Content Sync on Note Switch Only
    description: |
      Editor content synchronization with server MUST only occur when:

      2) user explicitly clicks refresh button
      3) workspace is changed

      Editor content MUST NOT be overwritten when:
      1) save operation completes
      2) selected note resource is refetched
      3) note list is reloaded

      Implementation requirements:
      - Track last-loaded note id to detect note switches vs resource updates.
      - Only update editor content when the note id changes.
      - Reset the last-loaded note id when workspace changes.

      enable the next save.

      Implementation requirements:
      - Store currentRevisionId locally and update after each successful save.
      - Use currentRevisionId as parent_revision_id for updates.
      - After note creation, set currentRevisionId from API response.
      - Fall back to selected note revision id only if currentRevisionId is unset.

  - id: REQ-FE-013
    title: Save Must Actually Persist to Server
    description: |
      Save operation MUST send the actual edited content to the server.
      Server MUST persist the content to the filesystem.
      Reloading the page MUST show the previously saved content.

      Failure modes to prevent:
      - Early return due to missing revision id
      - editorContent returning stale/empty value
      - API request missing markdown field
      - backend returning success before write completes

    title: Note Detail Loading State Management
    description: |
      When navigating between notes (from note list, class table, or any navigation),
      the loading state MUST properly clear and display the note content.
      The UI MUST NOT get stuck showing "Loading note..." indefinitely.
      Rapid sequential navigation between multiple notes MUST work smoothly without
      requiring page reloads.
    rationale: |
      SolidJS createResource can maintain loading=true even after data loads/fails,
      especially during rapid navigation. The fix checks loading state in conjunction
      with data presence to avoid infinite loading screens.
