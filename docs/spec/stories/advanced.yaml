    title: Voice-to-Class
    type: BYOAI
    as_a: mobile user
    i_want: to record a voice memo and have my chosen AI assistant structure it

      I can use the best AI model available (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
      without being locked into the app's built-in model.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - User records audio; app saves it as a note attachment
      - User invokes their connected MCP Agent (e.g., "Format this voice note")
      - Agent reads the transcript (via MCP), extracts fields, and updates the note with H2 headers

    title: Computational Notebooks
    type: Live Code
    as_a: data-driven user

    so_that: I can create live reports or analyze my own knowledge base within the app.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Markdown code blocks tagged `javascript` can be executed
      - Code execution is handled by explicit tooling (future)

    title: Agentic Refactoring
    type: BYOAI
    as_a: user with a messy workspace
    i_want: to ask my AI agent to "clean up this folder"
    so_that: I can leverage external intelligence to organize my knowledge base on demand.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - App exposes MCP resources for note discovery and updates
      - User asks Agent: "Find duplicates in Project X and merge them."
      - Agent executes the logic and presents the result for confirmation
