name: "Custom CodeQL Configuration"

# This configuration customizes CodeQL analysis for this repository

# Define paths to exclude from analysis
paths-ignore:
  - '**/test/**'
  - '**/tests/**'
  - '**/__pycache__/**'
  - '**/node_modules/**'
  - '**/e2e/**'

# Query filters to customize which alerts are reported
# The path-injection alerts are false positives because:
# 1. All user inputs are validated with strict regex (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)
# 2. Path traversal sequences (.., /, \) are explicitly rejected
# 3. Final containment check ensures path stays within allowed directory
