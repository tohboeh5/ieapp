# Research Plan: Knowledge Space App

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Task 1: Testing Frameworks for Python (FastAPI) and SolidJS (bunjs)

- **Task**: Identify suitable testing frameworks for the Python backend (FastAPI) and the SolidJS frontend (bunjs).
- **Context**: The `plan.md` indicates "Testing: NEEDS CLARIFICATION". We need to select appropriate tools to ensure code quality and adherence to TDD principles.

### Research Task 2: Best Practices for Python Library CLI Interface

- **Task**: Investigate best practices for implementing a command-line interface (CLI) for a Python library.
- **Context**: The "Constitution Check" in `plan.md` has "II. CLI Interface: NEEDS CLARIFICATION". The backend is intended to be published as a library, requiring a robust CLI.

### Research Task 3: Applying TDD Principles to Python (FastAPI) and SolidJS (bunjs)

- **Task**: Research how to effectively apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to both FastAPI backend and SolidJS frontend development.
- **Context**: The "Constitution Check" in `plan.md` has "III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE): NEEDS CLARIFICATION". This is a core principle that needs to be addressed.

### Research Task 4: Integration Testing Strategies for FastAPI and SolidJS

- **Task**: Explore strategies for integration testing between the FastAPI backend and the SolidJS frontend, including contract testing.
- **Context**: The "Constitution Check" in `plan.md` has "IV. Integration Testing: NEEDS CLARIFICATION". This is crucial for ensuring the proper functioning of the entire application.

### Research Task 5: fsspec Data Format for Versioning and Conflict Resolution

- **Task**: Investigate existing patterns and libraries for managing file-based data with versioning, history tracking, and conflict resolution using `fsspec`.
- **Context**: The `spec.md` and `data-model.md` now specify a detailed JSON-based data format for notes and workspaces, with a requirement for future versioning and conflict resolution. This task will explore how to best implement this with `fsspec`.

### Research Task 6: Workspace Management Best Practices

- **Task**: Research best practices for implementing workspace management in a multi-document application, including considerations for data isolation, access patterns, and efficient listing/deletion.
- **Context**: The introduction of the `Workspace` entity in `spec.md` and `data-model.md` requires a robust approach to managing these collections of notes.

### Research Task 7: Implementing Search with fsspec-only Storage

- **Task**: Investigate strategies and tools for implementing efficient keyword search across notes stored solely via `fsspec` in JSON format, without relying on a traditional database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Context**: The application explicitly avoids a separate database, so search must be performed directly on the `fsspec`-managed files. This requires exploring techniques for indexing, querying, and retrieving relevant notes from a file-based store, considering performance for up to 1,000 notes per workspace.

### Research Task 8: Comprehensive Error Handling and Resilience

- **Task**: Develop a comprehensive error handling strategy for both the backend and frontend, covering `fsspec` storage issues, API errors, and unexpected application states. Research best practices for graceful degradation and user feedback.
- **Context**: The `spec.md` mentions "Storage Unavailable" as an edge case, but a broader approach to system resilience is needed to ensure a robust user experience, especially with a file-based backend.

### Research Task 9: Security Considerations for a No-Authentication, File-Based System

- **Task**: Identify potential security risks in a local, no-authentication, file-based knowledge space app. Research mitigation strategies, such as recommendations for network isolation, OS-level file permissions, and data integrity checks.
- **Context**: The assumption of "No authentication is required" for home use necessitates understanding and addressing inherent security implications, even if the threat model is limited.
