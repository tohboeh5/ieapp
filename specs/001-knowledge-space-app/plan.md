# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a small-scale knowledge space app with a Python FastAPI backend and a bunjs+SolidJS frontend. The application will allow users to create, manage, and organize notes within distinct workspaces. Data persistence will leverage `fsspec` with a clearly defined JSON-based data format to support future versioning, history tracking, and conflict resolution. The backend will also be published as a Python library, `ieapp-cli`, which will be imported by the `backend` service.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.9+ (Backend, ieapp-cli), bunjs+SolidJS (Frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, fsspec (Backend), bunjs, SolidJS (Frontend)  
**Storage**: fsspec (local, s3, minio, azure blob, etc.) with a JSON-based file format for notes and workspace metadata.  
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Backend), Web browser (Frontend)
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: SC-001: Users can create, edit, or delete a note within 5 seconds. SC-002: The system can store and retrieve up to 1,000 notes without performance degradation. SC-003: Search queries return results in under 2 seconds for up to 1,000 notes. SC-004: Export and import operations work for notes up to 10 MB in size. SC-006: Users can create or delete a workspace within 3 seconds. SC-007: The system can manage up to 100 workspaces without performance degradation.  
**Constraints**: No authentication is required. Data retention policy is unlimited. Frontend and backend run on the same machine or within the same network. The chosen data format for fsspec will leverage existing tools or libraries for versioning and conflict resolution where possible.  
**Scale/Scope**: Small-scale knowledge space app for home use (1-3 people), up to 100 workspaces and 1,000 notes per workspace.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Library-First
- **Check**: Is the backend designed as a library first, with a clear, self-contained purpose?
- **Status**: PASS (Backend in Python, also published as a library `ieapp-cli`)

### II. CLI Interface
- **Check**: Does the `ieapp-cli` library expose functionality via a CLI?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Not explicitly stated, but implied for library usage) - *Research planned in research.md*

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Check**: Are tests written before implementation, following TDD principles?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Testing framework is unknown, TDD not explicitly mentioned) - *Research planned in research.md*

### IV. Integration Testing
- **Check**: Are integration tests planned for new library contracts, contract changes, and inter-service communication?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Testing framework is unknown, integration testing not explicitly mentioned) - *Research planned in research.md*

### V. Observability
- **Check**: Is structured logging required for CRUD operations?
- **Status**: PASS (FR-010: System MUST log all CRUD operations for audit purposes)

### VI. Simplicity
- **Check**: Does the design adhere to simplicity and YAGNI principles?
- **Status**: PASS (Small-scale app, lightweight frontend, initially local storage, JSON data format for fsspec)

### VII. fsspec Directory Structure for Versioning and Conflict Resolution
- **Check**: Is the fsspec directory structure clearly defined to support backend-managed versioning, history retrieval, and conflict resolution?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (The current directory structure in `data-model.md` is provisional and requires further design to explicitly support these features.) - *Research planned in research.md*

### VIII. Workspace Management
- **Check**: Are there clear guidelines for managing workspaces, including data isolation and efficient operations?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Workspace entity introduced, but best practices for management need research) - *Research planned in research.md*

### IX. Search Implementation with fsspec-only Storage
- **Check**: Is there a clear strategy for implementing efficient keyword search across notes stored solely via fsspec?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Search is a core requirement, but implementation without a traditional database needs research) - *Research planned in research.md*

### X. Error Handling and Resilience
- **Check**: Is there a comprehensive strategy for error handling and system resilience, especially concerning fsspec storage and unexpected states?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Requires detailed planning for various failure modes) - *Research planned in research.md*

### XI. Security Considerations
- **Check**: Are potential security risks for a no-authentication, file-based system identified and addressed?
- **Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Even for home use, security implications need to be understood and mitigated) - *Research planned in research.md*

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a web application structure with separate `ieapp-cli/`, `backend/` and `frontend/` directories at the repository root. The `ieapp-cli/` will contain the Python library. The `backend/` will contain Python source code for models, services, and API endpoints, along with its tests, and will import `ieapp-cli`. The `frontend/` will house the SolidJS application, including components, pages, and services, with its corresponding tests.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
