## Dependencies

- Phase 1 (Setup) -> Phase 2 (Foundational)
- Phase 2 (Foundational) -> Phase 3 (US1)
- Phase 2 (Foundational) -> Phase 4 (US2)
- Phase 3 (US1) -> Phase 4 (US2) (Notes depend on Workspaces)
- Phase 4 (US2) -> Phase 5 (US3)
- Phase 4 (US2) -> Phase 6 (US4)
- Phase 4 (US2) -> Phase 7 (US5)
- Phase 7 (US5) can be developed in parallel with other UI/API tasks once core Note/Workspace functionality is stable.
- Final Phase (Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns) can run in parallel with all other phases, but many tasks depend on core functionality being present.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **User Story 1 (Manage Workspaces)**:
    - Backend: T016, T017, T018 can be developed sequentially.
    - Frontend: T019, T020, T021 can be developed in parallel. T022 integrates them.
- **User Story 2 (Create, Edit, and Delete Notes)**:
    - Backend: T023, T024, T025 can be developed sequentially.
    - Frontend: T026, T027, T028, T029 can be developed in parallel. T030 integrates them.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, delivering incremental value. User Story 1 (Manage Workspaces) and User Story 2 (Create, Edit, and Delete Notes) are P1 and form the core MVP. Subsequent user stories will be integrated in priority order. Each user story will be developed with its backend API and frontend UI components, ensuring independent testability.

## Report

- **Total task count**: 49
- **Task count per user story**:
    - Setup: 13
    - Foundational: 2
    - US1 (Manage Workspaces): 7
    - US2 (Create, Edit, and Delete Notes): 8
    - US3 (Search Notes): 4
    - US4 (Export and Import Notes): 5
    - US5 (Show, Search, and Edit Notes with LLM): 3
    - Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns: 7
- **Parallel opportunities identified**: Many tasks within frontend development for each user story, and some backend tasks (e.g., defining models) can be done in parallel. Research tasks can also be done in parallel.
- **Independent test criteria for each story**: Clearly defined in each user story phase.
- **Suggested MVP scope**: User Story 1 (Manage Workspaces) and User Story 2 (Create, Edit, and Delete Notes).
- **Format validation**: All tasks follow the checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`.
