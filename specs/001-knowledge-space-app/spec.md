# Feature Specification: Knowledge Space App

**Feature Branch**: `[002-knowledge-space-app]`
**Created**: `2025-10-19`
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a small‑scale knowledge space app for home use (1‑3 people) that is very easy to operate. Backend in Python, hosted with FastAPI, also published as a library so users can easily run in their own systems. Backend uses fsspec for data store, allowing users to specify storage (local, s3, minio, azure blob, etc.). Initially local is fine. Frontend with bunjs+solidjs, lightweight, easy to edit and visualize."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create, Edit, and Delete Notes (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create, edit, and delete notes so that I can capture and manage information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables the knowledge space.

**Independent Test**: A user can perform a full CRUD cycle on a note and see the changes reflected immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user is on the notes list page, **When** they click "New Note" and submit a title and content, **Then** the note appears in the list.
2. **Given** an existing note, **When** the user edits the title or content and saves, **Then** the updated note is displayed.
3. **Given** an existing note, **When** the user deletes it, **Then** the note is removed from the list.

---

### User Story 2 - Search Notes (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to search notes by keyword so that I can quickly find relevant information.

**Why this priority**: Search improves usability for larger collections.

**Independent Test**: A user can enter a keyword and receive matching notes within a short time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a set of notes, **When** the user searches for "meeting", **Then** only notes containing the keyword in title or content are returned.

---

### User Story 3 - Export and Import Notes (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to export notes to Markdown and import from Markdown so that I can backup or migrate data.

**Why this priority**: Provides data portability.

**Independent Test**: A user can export a note to a Markdown file and later import it back, preserving content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a note, **When** the user selects "Export", **Then** a Markdown file is downloaded.
2. **Given** a Markdown file, **When** the user selects "Import", **Then** a new note is created with the file’s content.

---

### User Story 4 - Show, Search, and Edit Notes with LLM (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want to show, search, and edit notes using an LLM as an app in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so that I can interact with my knowledge space more naturally.

**Why this priority**: This is a core feature for leveraging LLMs within the knowledge space.

**Independent Test**: A user can interact with the LLM to perform these actions and see the results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user is in the LLM interface, **When** they ask to "show me notes about X", **Then** relevant notes are displayed.
2. **Given** the user is in the LLM interface, **When** they ask to "search for Y", **Then** notes matching the search criteria are returned.
3. **Given** an existing note and the user is in the LLM interface, **When** they ask to "edit this note to include Z", **Then** the note is updated with the new content.

### Edge Cases

- **Storage Unavailable**: If the configured storage backend is unreachable, the system should display an error message and retry automatically.
- **Concurrent Edits**: If two users edit the same note simultaneously, the last write wins and the user is notified of the conflict.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and delete notes via the API.
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist notes using fsspec, supporting local, S3, MinIO, Azure Blob, etc.
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on notes.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow configuration of the storage backend through a simple config file or environment variable.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a lightweight frontend built with bunjs and SolidJS for note editing and visualization.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support keyword search across note titles and content.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow exporting notes to Markdown format.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow importing notes from Markdown files.
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle concurrent edits gracefully, with a last‑write‑wins strategy and user notification.
- **FR-010**: System MUST log all CRUD operations for audit purposes.
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with an LLM via MCP to allow showing, searching, and editing notes.

### Key Entities

- **Note**: Represents a knowledge entry.
  - *Attributes*: `id` (UUID), `title` (string), `content` (string), `tags` (list of strings), `created_at` (timestamp), `updated_at` (timestamp).

## Success Criteria

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create, edit, or delete a note within 5 seconds.
- **SC-002**: The system can store and retrieve up to 1,000 notes without performance degradation.
- **SC-003**: Search queries return results in under 2 seconds for up to 1,000 notes.
- **SC-004**: Export and import operations work for notes up to 10 MB in size.
- **SC-005**: The system remains available 99.9 % of the time over a 30‑day period.

---

## Assumptions

- No authentication is required; the app is intended for a small, trusted user base.
- Data retention policy is unlimited; notes are kept indefinitely unless manually deleted.
- The frontend and backend run on the same machine or within the same network for simplicity.

---

## Notes

- This specification is written for non‑technical stakeholders and intentionally omits implementation details.
